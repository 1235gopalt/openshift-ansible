# ossh is an ssh replacement.

Ossh uses a dynamic inventory cache in order to lookup hostnames and translate them
to something meaningful such as an IP address or dns name.

This allows us to treat our servers as cattle and not as pets.

In order to setup bash completion, source the following script:
/path/to/repository/openshift-online-ansible/bin/ossh_bash_completion

This bash_completion script will look at the cached version of your
multi_ec2 results in ~/.ansible/tmp/.  It will then parse a few
host.env out of the json and return them to be completable.

If you have not run the ossh command and it has not laid down
a cache file the completions will not be available.

You can populate the cache by running `ossh --list`.  This
will populate the cache file and the completions should
become available.
